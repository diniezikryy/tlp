## My process

- First time learning to use Gulp, from Coder Coder's channel on youtube. Also tried to replicate the methods she used to build the website. This is my first attempt in trying to organise the files in my frontend projects, and also my first time designing something from start to finish. Also attempted to split the css file into different scss files, grouping them in components, which is similar to react i think?

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- SASS
- Gulp

### What I learned

- Learnt to study the figma design file more thoroughly, which I failed to do so at first, and had thus I took way longer than expected to finish the project.

- Learnt to split my design files into different components, utility files and global files.

- Learnt to use Gulp for workflow and applied BEM naming conventions to organise CSS files.

- Practiced mostly flexbox and also laying out of elements.

- Used a desktop-first design, and simultaneously made it mobile responsive.

### Continued development

- Understanding how to use Flexbox more in-depth as I had trouble making things work the way i wanted it to.

- I need to standardise some of the methods i used for laying out, such as margin or padding.
